# Home Rules:
- **Death** - Coming back from a downed/incapacitated state **adds 2 levels of Exhaustion**.  
    - **Death saves** are rolled by/to the DM.
    - You can auto-succeed on your death-saving throws by taking a **lingering injury** (rolled on the table)
    - Death-saving throw results **only reset** after a long rest.
- **Flavour** - **Flavour is free!** If you want 'Burning Hands' to do Acid damage, we can rename it! If you want the stats of a crossbow but the look of a composite bow, we can do that!!
- **Weapon Mastery** - You can master weapons, gaining new abilities and possibly extra damage.
- **Balder's Gate** - Some rules from BG3 are adopted in this world:
	- Potions can be consumed via **Bonus Action**
	- **Tavern Brawler** rules from BG3, as they're just better than regular 5e
- **Spells** - Spells from the D&D 5e 2024 rules can be used with consent from the DM - Cleared examples include:
	- **Sleep**,
- **Rule of Cool** - If something is cool and makes your character/the scene better, let's do it!
