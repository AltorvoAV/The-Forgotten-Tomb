# Act I
The start of what's to come.

The first gathering of this unlikely company was not destiny, but a summons. Each received a royal quest, each obeyed, and thus an unlikely fellowship was forged in the halls of [[King Sedulus II\|King Sedulus II]]: [[Drachen Lokeriyan\|Drachen Lokeriyan]], [[Alyssia\|Alyssia]], [[Skapa\|Skapa]], [[Khelek Istar\|Khelek Istar]], and [[Dolomir Bloodmark\|Dolomir Bloodmark]].

Their charge: to find [[Dr Zagak Iscara\|Dr Zagak Iscara]], the royal inventor of [[Locations/Brugrove - City of the Iron Guard\|Brugrove]] who recently went missing.

The trail was soon to be paved in blood. Kobolds were slain for daring to “save” Skapa. The [[Stalker's Tavern\|Stalker's Tavern]] filled with cultists fell under their blades, leaving behind a map to the Doctor’s dwelling. That night, Drachen dreamt of [[Lord Squark Arrowvis, Earl of Peckersberg\|Lord Squark Arrowvis, Earl of Peckersberg]], who seemed more parable than prophecy. The dream ending on sight of a withering [[Feywild\|Feywild]].

At the Doctor’s house they found scorch marks, tomes, and the [[Sword of Sorrow \|Sword of Sorrow ]]— a relic whose weight Drachen still carries. And a previous master yet unknown: [[Morningstar\|Morningstar]]. A map led them further: to a burial ground marked by a plinth of names — [[Kurtulmak\|Kurtulmak]], [[Takhisis\|Takhisis]], [[Atropal\|Atropal]], & [[Yondalla\|Yondalla]].

There, they found Iscara. No longer the man he had been, but a gaunt figure charging something with green flames. They struck him down, though whether they _killed_ him remains a question.

The necklace was taken. The corpse was never found. They returned to Brugrove, claiming the Doctor had gone mad. The King mourned, then offered them another task. [[Locations/The Isle of Black\|The Isle of Black]] had begun to swallow men whole, and leave behind a calling card: [[The Black Robin\|The Black Robin]].

Thus ends the first chapter of their tale. Not with triumph, but with suspicion. For the gods named on that plinth were not chosen by chance. And Iscara’s fall was nothing but... a prelude.
