# Thieves Cant

> [!WARNING]
> If you ain't a Rogue, STOP LOOKING AT THIS!
## **Greeting**  
The greeting they use identifies them to your rogue as a representative of a particular thieves’ guild.

Note: Pickpocket removes PC’s purse and replaces it in a different pocket. Either handwave this as done by an expert, or roll + 5 Dex + x2 proficiency vs. PC’s Wis (perception). If Pickpocket fails, let PC respond as they choose; that’s the risk a pickpocket takes.

## **Nostalgia**  
The exact phrasing does not matter. The important element is the time frame, which reflects the urgency of the message to follow.

|Example|Urgency|
|---|---|
|“I haven’t seen you _in 6 months_”|Not urgent / optional|
|“Wow, it’s been _a few years_”|Low urgency|
|“Can you believe it’s been _over 10 years_?”|High urgency|
|“Seems like you left the village _a lifetime ago_”|Extreme urgency|
|“Gosh, it feels _like forever_ since I’ve seen you”|Utmost urgency / Not optional|

## **Catching Up**  
The messenger mentions a relative of the [[Entities/Player Characters\|PCs]]. There are two elements to this innocent statement. First, the specific relative mentioned identifies the source of the message or quest.
Second, the tenor of the statement reflects the subtext of the message. The tone of the message may be friendly, neutral, or hostile.

|Relation code|Message sender|
|---|---|
|Uncle|Government official|
|Great Uncle|Monarch / Sovereign|
|Mother / Father|Rogue’s superior in Guild|
|Grandmother / Grandfather|Guild Master|
|Cousin|Rogue’s peer in Guild|
|Mother-in-law / Father-in-law|Superior rank in allied Guild|
|Step-Mother|Member of rival Guild|
|Great Grandmother / Great Grandfather|Over-Guild Official|
|Little brother / Little sister|Guild initiate|
|Puppy / Kitten|PC’s actual family member|
|Demented Murderer|DM|

|Example of Tone|Implication|
|---|---|
|“I was so sorry to hear about your Grandmother’s passing. What a tragedy.”|(Hostile) Your Guildmaster is threatening to kill you if you botch this job|
|“Your Uncle has so many nieces and nephews, I don’t know how he remembers all your names”|(Neutral) The government official can hire someone else if you don’t take the job|
|“Remember that time we shaved your Step-Mother’s chihuahua? That was funny. We were awful kids, she didn’t deserve that.”|(Friendly) A member or official of a rival Guild pleads for your help. Perhaps they are willing to make peace, or claim previous hostility was due to a misunderstanding.|

## **Chit-chat**  
This part can vary the most. It gives the nature of the job or message, as well as additional information such as identifying targets, cautions, or other parameters. If necessary, the relations listed above can be used again with the same meanings. For example, “Your uncle says don’t forget to wish your step-mother a happy birthday,” meaning “a government official wants you to assassinate a rival guild leader.”

|Code|Meaning|

|Invite your friends|if you tell them, you have to kill them|
|Give credit where credit is due|frame someone else for the crime|
|Signature / Signed|reveal job originator to send a message|

**Enough about me, how are you?**  
The messenger would gladly skip payment info. Contract negotiation is much more favorable for the quest-giver _after_ the job is done. If the PC neglects to ask for payment, it’s their own fault. They can ask and negotiate by inquiring about the Messenger’s family.  
“How’s your little (tyke, baby girl, nephew, poodle, whatever)?” means “How much does the job pay?”  
_“Oh, he’s great. He’s 9 now.”_ In-game, the number indicates a range on a scale of 1 – 20 how much the quest-giver is offering. Mechanically, you can roll for the money portion of a CR 9 monster’s hoard (magic items NOT included).  
“Really? I thought he was, like, 12.” _or_ “So your older girl is 12, then?” This represents the PCs demand: I want level 12 payment for this job.  
_”Yeah, but junior will be 10 next month.”_ This is the messenger’s counter-offer: level 10 payment.

## **Do we have a deal?**

|Code|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Will I see you at the harvest festival (or any other hometown gathering) this year?|Will you take the job?|
|Yes, I’ll be there|Yes, I’ll be there|
|No, I am otherwise engaged|No, I am otherwise engaged|
|Give my regards to your Granny|A pox on thee, and your guild master as well|
|…and have your pets spayed or neutered|I’m going to spay and neuter your family members|
