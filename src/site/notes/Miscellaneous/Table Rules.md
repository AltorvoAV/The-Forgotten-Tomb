# Table Rules
D&D is a fun social roleplaying table-top game. At its heart, is communication & storytelling!

> [!IMPORTANT] Important
> The game literally does not work without communicating with each other <3
> > [!WARNING] Super Important!
> > Especially between player & DM - vice versa!

## Table Etiquette
1. **Be nice** and fun to play with!
2. **Respect** everyone at the table!
3. **Talk to the table** (players/DM) about EVERYTHING!
	- I don't want anyone to feel negatively surprised by anything mid-game. Even the most earnest attempts at interactions can feel out-of-the-blue if the parties are not in communication.
	- A lot of emotions & time go into playing D&D, **transparency** is key!
4. **Don't grief** your party.
	- No, interparty conflicts.
5. Show up **on time** (or notify ahead of time).
	- Obviously, life can get in the way, but this goes back to rule 2 (respect) for each other's time.

## Quick Player/DM Expectations
1. **Alcohol/Narcotics** - fine as long as it doesn't go too far (disruptive/break character).
2. **Phones/Devices** - I can't compete w/ subway surfers - attention is important, limit distractions.
3. **Rolls** - You can roll perception/insight whenever you want - other rules found: [[Miscellaneous/Home Rules\|Home Rules]].
4. **Player Expectations**:
	1. Have character goals.
	2. What do you want to achieve, tell...etc.
	3. **`Take notes`** - either in character or generally.
5. **Discomfort** - Sometimes things happen that make us feel uncomfortable - ideally, **`notify the table DM/Player`** and we will sort it immediately or away from the table.
6. **Player Agency** - Want you to feel empowered to decide what your character does.
	1. Sometimes, things will happen out of player/character control (such is life), but I will only do this where I feel it make narrative sense, especially if it's something we have communicated together.
7. **Game Balance**:
	1. Fights are at **deadly** difficulty.
	2. Some characters will be stronger than other, but I will try to balance where it makes sense.
8. **Spotlight** - Share the spotlight, but also enjoy the light when it's on you!
9. **Meta-knowledge** - NO. Keep yourself honest, everyone makes mistakes.
10. **Ret-Cons** - Allowed wherever makes sense! Even if that is for rule 9.
11. **DM Expectations**:
	1. **Style** - I'm a RAW (Rules as Written) 5e '14 DM, but adjust rules when they're not fun.
		1. Check [[Miscellaneous/Home Rules\|Home Rules]] for more info.
	2. **Absence** - Ideally 2+ players present, but can continue w/ just 2 players.
	3. **Narrative Authority** - We tell the story together. I believe if either one of us is telling our own story, we might as well write a book. Give me your ideas, and I'll intersperse mine throughout until we have a collaborative storytelling masterpiece.

## Character Creation
- **Creation Questions** - Ask me anything, locations, groups, gods, NPCs...etc.
	- Also welcome to create groups, & NPCs.
- **Stats** - Roll 5d6, remove the lowest 2 / Keep highest 3.
	- If you wish to take a penalty in a stat for a boon, we can discuss.
- **Alignment** - [[Home Page\|The Forgotten Tomb]] is very amoral, true 'good' is a perspective.
- **Races & Classes** - All races/classes are allowed (unless otherwise stated below) - Be aware, some races will be targeted within [[Locations/Nyropa\|Nyropa]] due to their connection with Divine beings ([[Entities/Gods/Gods\|Gods]]).
	- **Excluded Races/Classes** - None as of yet.
- **Death**:
	- Upon death, new characters will start from Level 1 (and lvl up much faster).
	- Where you choose to play a new character, you will start from level 1-4 (as agreed by DM & player alike).
