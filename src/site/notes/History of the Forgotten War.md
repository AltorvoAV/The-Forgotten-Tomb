# The Great Forgotten War

By Douglas Montgomery, Royal Historian of [[Cities/Brugrove - City of the Iron Guard\|Brugrove]].
Written in the year 168 AR (After [[History of the Forgotten War\|The Reckoning]])

## Part I: _Foreword – The Fog of Memory:_

> *“It is not the absence of truth that frightens us—but the possibility that we once knew it.”*
> – [[Douglas Montgomery\|Douglas Montgomery]], Royal Historian of Brugrove

In this work, I have attempted to gather and preserve the fragments we possess from what scholars now call _The Great Forgotten War_, a conflict that reshaped the world almost two centuries past. What occurred in the skies above Brugrove, and across the veins of Nyropa from Porthca to the Ruins of Aenbeor Keep, have left scars that time refuses to heal.

But reader, let me be honest: this tome is not a history—it is a confession. It is a gathering of loose threads, some rotten, others golden, none of them complete. Those of us born before _The Reckoning_ remember only but glimpses. Dreams. Feelings. But not facts. We remember the burn of magic on the skin and the way the sun _paused_ above the Isle of Black—but not the why. We remember falling to our knees—but not what name we cried out. This is the frailty of memory.

There are still some who claim to know the truth. Some speak of a great betrayal among gods. Others of the people’s loss of faith, starving divinity of power. And some scream incoherent babbles of pain and ruin.

This book includes accounts from across Nyropa: the devout and the godless, soldiers and sailors, poets and pragmatists. Their stories contradict. They argue. Some lie. But perhaps, between the lines, you may glimpse something real.

To preserve the dignity of memory, I have not corrected these accounts. I have only bound them together.

May the truth one day forgive us.

## Part II: _Accounts from Across Nyropa:_

### 📍 _Brugrove_

> “I saw the sky shatter. Not in metaphor, nor madness—but in glass. The heavens were a bowl and it cracked like porcelain, and through the breach I saw light too bright for thought. I heard names that scratched at my bones, and I remember… I remember weeping. Not for what I saw, but for what I had already forgotten.”

### 📍 _Valonde_

> “The Iron Guard arrived one dawn and said nothing. They appeared across different cities, looking for something. I know not where they came from, only that they made home in Brugrove protecting the monarchs past. We welcomed them, for the gods had left us.
> 
> – Excerpt from _The Valonde Archives_, Section 3.1.2

### 📍 _The Lost City_

> “We were trading spice and jewellery when the sky opened. The mirrors cracked across the walls and none of us could remember the rates we’d just agreed upon. It seemed trivial. I asked my brother if the city always had thirteen bars—he said we’ve always had twelve. That’s when I knew.”

### 📍 _Porthca_

> “We signed a pact of trade and magic with Brugrove the day the moon broke into crescents. They gave us artefacts that sang, and told us not to touch them bare. But our ship never made it to port. The sea rebelled. Something in it… rebelled.”

### 📍 _Shazahath Mountains_

> “We heard them screaming from the peaks. The priests said not to look. Yet I felt the urge to. The mountains were burning inwards. That’s the best way I can describe it. Something inside was trying to crawl out.”
> 
> – Notes from a mountain scout, now blind

### Part III: _On the Isle of Black_

> “I do not recall it being an island.”
> 
> – Most common quote from elderly citizens across Nyropa

There is no consensus on when the Isle of Black separated from Brugrove. Some maps show it always was. Others do not. Some scholars believe it was once a temple. Others say it is a wound. Several independent writers, prior to the publication of this volume, attempted to describe what lies there—each manuscript has since been lost, burned, or never existed, depending on whom you ask. Others think it a ploy to encourage trade and tourism.

One notable fragment reads:

> “The one who wrote the script sleeps beneath the roots of all things. Their name was once the word for magic itself.”
> 
> _(Note: This line has since been redacted in all other copies.)_

### Part IV: _On Faith and the Fracture_

> “The gods did not die—they were forgotten.” – Priest of the Silent Chapel, whose name was never recorded

> “There are names I should not write. But if I do not, Silence will devour them faster.” — [**Douglas Montgomery**](https://www.notion.so/Douglas-Montgomery-1c9f0e2003e680e68eeac54c9d71bf5f?pvs=21), Royal Historian of Brugrove

Some religious orders claim that divine power faded because mortal belief waned. That in our greed and faithlessness, we starved our gods. Others claim the gods betrayed each other—that the world was collateral.

Among the scattered accounts of the Great Forgotten War, five names recur like bloodstains that will not wash out: [Thrym](https://www.notion.so/Thrym-969f2f10338c4f2aa57a2c955ddbb426?pvs=21), [Bane](https://www.notion.so/Bane-781574ae39c9473294b7afc0f9d94e26?pvs=21), [Bhaal](https://www.notion.so/Bhaal-fe8c83b93e244bedb5dcbfcfbc69f14c?pvs=21), [Maglubiyet](https://www.notion.so/Maglubiyet-f9b978197dc1406fb938fdc66b7ea9e8?pvs=21), [Atropal](https://www.notion.so/Atropal-1e19db5218ec4566b60c45dd7eeb2674?pvs=21), and .

The aftermath of their deaths was not limited to the divine. Records tell of priests who clawed their own eyes out, paladins who murdered their families, and temples where every acolyte drowned themselves on the same night. Not faith _fading_, but faith _fraying_—a madness born out of the tether being cut too suddenly.

A merchant’s journal recovered from Valonde puts it plainly:

> “It was as if the gods themselves had been guillotined, and their worshippers felt the blade as keenly as the neck.”

Whether they can return is a question no one dares answer aloud. Some reference an old religious law, _Oblivati Mori_, insisting that as long as their names remain, so too does the chance of resurrection. Others argue that their corpses now rot in the plane between all, feeding something darker.

A secretive sect of monks left rare carvings referencing a “Silver Veil,” behind which all true names are hidden. Their writings are fragmentary and mostly symbolic. Attempts to study them result in headaches, and forgetfulness, or in one case, madness. Most result in the scholar becoming bored, and turning to more modern puzzles.

One poem recovered from a ruined monastery reads:

> “Before the first clock struck / the tongue was whole / the name was known / the magic spoke itself.”
> 
> _(Most of the stanzas are unreadable.)_

### Part V: _On Magic and Time_

Magic is not what it was. That much is certain. Even those who claim arcane mastery admit that the flow has changed. There are spells described in pre-Reckoning scrolls that no longer function. Entire schools of magic seem altered.

Several mages describe the sensation as if someone were “turning down the volume” on the Weave. The official stance of the College of Porthca is that _“The Weave has corrected itself.”_ Others aren’t so sure.

> “I cast a spell once—a simple one—to remember a name. The spell shattered. My eyes bled. And all I remembered was that the name was never mine to hold.”
