# The World of [[Locations/Nyropa\|Nyropa]]
> *"Nyropa is a mirror. Where noone likes their reflection."*
>- [[Douglas Montgomery\|Douglas Montgomery]], Royal Historian of Brugrove

[[Locations/Nyropa\|Nyropa]] is alive with consequence. Gods fall. Kings lie. Friends betray. Shadows scheme. Silence watches.
The question is not whether Nyropa will break you. The question is, what will you be when it does?
