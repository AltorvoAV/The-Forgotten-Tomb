# The Damned
Members of [[Entities/Organizations/The Damned\|The Damned]] eternally serve [[Cities/The Lost City - City of Thieves\|The Lost City]] as monks of neutrality who oversee [[The Ledger\|The Ledger]], an ancient book which contains all debts of those alive & dead.

The majority of their ranks consist of ex-criminals who could not pay their debts in time.


## Becoming Damned
If you are unlucky enough not to be assassinate or beaten to death after failing to pay your debts, [[Entities/Organizations/The Black Hand\|The Black Hand]] may choose to make you one of [[Entities/Organizations/The Damned\|The Damned]]. This process sews the lips of the damned and enacts a ritual to bind your life essence to the world, ensuring your eternal servitude as payment for your debts.
